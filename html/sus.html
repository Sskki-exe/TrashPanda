        <h3> Sustainable Living </h3>
        <div>
            <p>Living sustainably doesn't mean completely changing the way you live. It's actually all about making small
                changes to everyday activites and methods to reduce your environmental impact. The following will give you heaps of super easy
                and cost-efficient tips to help you 'hack' Sustainability!
            </p>

        <h3> Grocery Shopping ... </h3>
        <div>
            <p>Most grocery stores have taken great steps to eliminate the use of single-use plastic bags, either by phasing them out completely,
                adding a fee for purchase and creating stronger re-useable plastic bags. Unfortunately, even if you have your own re-useable bags
                sometimes we buy some fruits and veggies and pop them in plastic bags or we forget to bring our re-useable bags with us. It's inevitable
                that we will eventually consume some form of plastic when grocery shopping, so here's some tips to minimise the occurance of plastic use:
                The perfect hack is keeping bags, and fresh poduce baggies in your car or bag. It means even if you forget to grab some, you'll always have spare
                with you. Also, if you want some fresh produce cotton baggies, the best place I've found to get them is at thrift stores! 
                If all else fails, instead of places your fresh tomatoes in those plastic produce bags, grab a paper bag from the mushroom section!

            another neat little tip for all bubble tea lovers, plastic bubble tea cups ARE NOT single use (they are designed to be heat resistant meaning you 
            can throw these bad boys in the washing machine or even handwash and they'll be good as new)! Meaning, any cup you have, you can take it
            back next time and ask to use your recycled cup instead of a new one. Add to this your reuseable straw and suddenly an experience that would
            typically generate so much plastic waste now generates none! If you want to spend a little bit more on a slightly less flimsy bubble tea
            cup, you can always purchase a thermos or thermo cup with the same capacity and ask for your drink in that!

            <h3> School Supplies </h3>
            <div>
                <p> Some school supplies need to be bought brand new, yearly. Others dont. Tons of Op-shops have text books and notebooks that are second-hand.
                    Lots of books that were bought and then simply never used can be found thrifting, this also applies to some stationary goods as well. Obviously don't 
                    head to the local vinnies to buy pens and pencils, but for folders, file organisers, pen cups, textbooks, dictionaries, etc, hit up your local op-shop
                    first to see what you can use second-hand!

            <h3> Consumer choices </h3>
            <div>
                <p>Evaluate the products you purchase and the Sustainability of those companies and the individual goods. Some companies aren't committted to 
                    sustainability in their production processes and choosing to support these companies can affect the environment quite severely. Start researching
                    products with minimal waste packaging or sustainable production that are around the same price point and slowly start making a swap. 
                    One of my favourite companies is HappyHumanHabits, a inititive that aims to eliminate plastic use in cleaning products. You make a one-time 
                    purchase of cleaning bottles and soap dispensers and then purchase tablets that when combined with water, create safe cleaning products. After the
                    initial bottle purchase, each tablet is much cheaper than it would be to buy a new bottle, and they offer bulk tablet packages that increase savings
                    even further. And the icing on top, HappyHumanHabits have now opened manufacturing locations in Australia, meaning no international shipping, and 
                    carbon neutral shipping!
